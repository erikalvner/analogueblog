      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-----whats-going-on&#34;&gt;So &amp;mdash; what&amp;rsquo;s going on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it short, Kodak is increasing the prices of their films once again. Most price increases will be around the 10% mark, but some unfortunate ones, such as Kodak Gold, will go up by a whopping 30%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implications-of-price-increases&#34;&gt;Implications of price increases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmzhsnUMwrQ&#34;&gt;Overexposed&amp;rsquo;s video&lt;/a&gt; on this. He ended it with a small rant about how these constant increases in price will essentially kill film photography. When YouTubers hype cameras up, their prices skyrocket. Kodak raises the price yearly, way above the rate of inflation. Even the hemicals are getting more expensive. Film photographers just can&amp;rsquo;t catch a break.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;implications-of-price-increases&#34;&gt;Implications of price increases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmzhsnUMwrQ&#34;&gt;Overexposed&amp;rsquo;s video&lt;/a&gt; on this.

Kodak raises the price yearly, way above the rate of inflation. Even the hemicals are getting more expensive. Film photographers just can&amp;rsquo;t catch a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one question remains, then &amp;mdash; how do I keep shooting film without getting ruined?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-a-few-things-clear-for-dumb-americans&#34;&gt;Making a few things clear (for dumb Americans)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m European. My country, Sweden, never signed some document about the euro and we ended up just keeping the Swedish crown as our currency. I will be discussing prices in this post in euros. If you need to check the difference between dollars and euros, just google it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means that it might be possible to get stuff for even cheaper in the US or other parts of the world. Or that the tips I leave in the post may cost more in the US than in Europe (Foma products for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is also meant for someone that isn&amp;rsquo;t already well versed in the world of film photography. This is to be seen as a guide for total noobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;its-black-and-white&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s black and white&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start shooting black and white. B/W photography is what will get you into the darkroom for real and actually do your own prints. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to handle in all ways compared to colour negatives and it&amp;rsquo;s hell of a lot cheaper. If you want to get into cheap photography, you have no choice. Unless you bulk roll cinema film, but we&amp;rsquo;ll touch more on that later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one last thing. You need to develop your film yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the steps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-steps&#34;&gt;The steps!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-1---bulk-roll&#34;&gt;Step 1 - Bulk roll&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/onthecheap/bulk.jpg&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Bulk rolling means that you buy a long, usually 30m, spool of film. You then, in complete darkness, load it into a little machine that enables you to load empty film cassettes with film from the spool, all in complete daylight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, you need to buy the film and the machine, of course. But you also need a pair of scissors, empty film cassettes and some strong tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buy already empty cassettes on most welk stocked shops for analogue photography, or ask your local lab if they have old film cassettes that they haven&amp;rsquo;t opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the price? Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Ilford HP5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;roll of Ilford HP5&lt;/strong&gt; costs &lt;strong&gt;9 euros&lt;/strong&gt; at fotoimpex as of writing this post.&lt;br&gt;
A &lt;strong&gt;30m bulk roll of HP5&lt;/strong&gt; costs &lt;strong&gt;130 euros&lt;/strong&gt; at fotoimpex as of writing this post post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 30m bulk roll is split up into roughly 18 rolls. So 130 euros divided by the 18 rolls means that you get €7,20 per roll, compared to €9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do the same comparsion for Fomapan, you end up saving more than half the cost. A 36 exposure roll of Foma400 costs about €5,50 whereas a bulk loaded roll of Foma400 ends up at €2,55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-2---cheap-chemicals&#34;&gt;Step 2 - Cheap chemicals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having left the film itself behind, you also need to be able to get your hands on cheap chemicals. I would strongly advise any newcomer to buy Rodinal, Fomafix and Kodak Photo-flo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/onthecheap/rodinal.jpg&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Rodinal is a very very cheap one-shot (means you pour it out the sink when done) developer with an amazing shelf life. It&amp;rsquo;s said that they can be stored for up to 40 years without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having developed, you need a stop bath. Stop baths are actually just acidic solutions and nothing more. You can either add some &amp;ldquo;ättiksprit&amp;rdquo; as it&amp;rsquo;s called in Sweden to some water and be done with it. If you live somewhere where they don&amp;rsquo;t sell ättiksprit (vinegar essance according to Google), you can make an acidic stop bath out of regular tap water and a bunch of citric acid. Be on the lookout though, it can start to grow mold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the fixer, I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with Fomafix, from the same people that made Fomapan. It has a shelf life of about a year and is very cheap per use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You only use about 2-3 drops of the Photo-flo per development. It will make sure your film dries well and doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave water stains. It&amp;rsquo;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-3---diy-film-scanner&#34;&gt;Step 3 - DIY film scanner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now you&amp;rsquo;re shot and developed your photos, but what are you going to do with them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best would of course be a darkroom where you can make analogue prints from all your photos. This will be quite expensive if you&amp;rsquo;re a total noob. If you&amp;rsquo;re serious about photography, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you already have a somewhat decent digital camera laying around that you used before getting into film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to use that to build this:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/onthecheap/scan.jpg&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the skeleton of an old enlarger I found at a thrift store for about €15. Onto it, I attached a €18 tripod head with a 1/4th inch bolt. I mount my camera onto the tripod head and I can then adjust all settings I need. The wheel on the right makes it possible to change the height of the camera to match your negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this, I also had to buy a macro lens that worked for my camera. I decided on an old Sigma lens for the Nikon mount (with an adapter ring for my Canon DSLR) that cost me about €80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add a bit more cost, I use the Lomography DigitaLIZA PLUS. It&amp;rsquo;s a small light table with holders for medium format, 127 and 35mm film. It&amp;rsquo;s built well and works wonderfully for scanning at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll add a few sample shots taken with bulk rolled film, developed in cheap chemicals and scanned with the DIY scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To introduce myself quickly, the name&amp;rsquo;s Erik and I&amp;rsquo;m into analogue photography. This will be the first post on this blog, hopefully of many. You can find my portfolio &lt;a href=&#34;https://kallmoraberget.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the camera in question on eBay for about 260 euros. Finding one within Europe is very hard and I threw myself over the purchase button as quickly as I could. If you want to know more about the camera&amp;rsquo;s history and background, I strongly advise you to read Mike Eckman&amp;rsquo;s blog post about it, which you can find &lt;a href=&#34;https://mikeeckman.com/2021/08/suzuki-press-van-1953/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I bought the camera in question on eBay for about 260 euros. Finding one within Europe is very hard and I threw myself over the purchase button as quickly as I could. If you want to know more about the camera&amp;rsquo;s history and background, I strongly advise you to read Mike Eckman&amp;rsquo;s blog post about it, which you can find &lt;a href=&#34;https://mikeeckman.com/2021/08/suzuki-press-van-1953/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its name, it has nothing to do with the very famous company Suzuki, of which I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;re already aware. Maker or motorcycles and &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzuki is a very common surname in Japan. The creator of this camera, Ryohei Suzuki, worked as a lens designer at what was then called Asahi. You probably know it as Pentax. When his idea of a medium format press camera didn&amp;rsquo;t spark their interest, he decided to start the Suzuki Optical Company which manufactured the Suzuki Press Van and the Press Van 120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I strongly advise you to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://mikeeckman.com/2021/08/suzuki-press-van-1953/&#34;&gt;Mike Eckman&amp;rsquo;s blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it. He and I don&amp;rsquo;t have the same version, as the camera was released in two different editions. The camera he reviewed was the original Suzuki Press Van whereas I&amp;rsquo;m in possession of the Suzuki Press Van-120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;functions&#34;&gt;Functions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &amp;mdash; onto the functions of the camera. Like I said, there were two renditions of the camera. The Press Van and the Press Van-120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;versions--format&#34;&gt;Versions &amp;amp; format&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several differences between the two versions, with the main one being the format. While both are medium format cameras, the original one featured an insert that allowed you to shoot 35mm as well as 6x6. The one I have, the Press Van-120, instead offers you 6x6 or 6x4,5. With the latter model they scrapped the idea of having a separate insert and instead provided built in flaps to allow for the 6x4,5 aspect ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original model also featured an automatic frame counter, which went out the window with the latter revision. In my model, you simply use the red window on the back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/suzukipressvan/sidan.jpg&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: darkblue;&#34; &gt;From the back&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To be able to distinguish which format you&amp;rsquo;re shooting, you rotate the pressure plate when loading the film. Rotating it makes sure that you can only see one of the numbers through the red windows when advancing the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lens-aperture-and-shutter-speeds&#34;&gt;Lens, aperture and shutter speeds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;sharpness&#34;&gt;Sharpness&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipped with an Asahi Takumar lens, the shots taken with it are quite stunning and impressively sharp. If there was one thing I&amp;rsquo;d praise this camera for, it&amp;rsquo;s probably the sharpness of the lens. I can&amp;rsquo;t really see any degradation of sharpness around the corners of the image, or anywhere really. To be quite honest, it&amp;rsquo;s just an overall amazing lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 75mm, it&amp;rsquo;s on the wider end of the spectrum of &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; focal lengths. Perfect for what I had in mind when buying the camera &amp;mdash; having a medium format I can carry with me at all times and get most of what I want into the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/suzukipressvan/sidebyside.png&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: darkblue;&#34; &gt;Show of sharpness.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h5 id=&#34;aperture&#34;&gt;Aperture&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lens starts at an aperture of an alright 3,5 and stops all the way down to 22. It remains sharp throughout the entire range. I have yet to figure out what its sharpest aperture is, as I tend to forget what settings I&amp;rsquo;ve used when shooting. One thing is clear however &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get that famed &amp;ldquo;medium format look&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/suzukipressvan/matildahjordis.jpg&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: darkblue;&#34; &gt;Medium format look.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A very important feature is that the aperture &amp;ldquo;ring&amp;rdquo;, if you can call it that, clicks. This means you can use the camera in what is essentially shutter priority mode. The shutter dial spins freely, but if you have a set shutter and need to adjust the aperture, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to actually look at the front of the lens to adjust it if you get used to where the stops are or in what order they come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;shutter&#34;&gt;Shutter&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lens itself is not only the aperture control but also the wheel for setting the shutter speed as well as cocking the Seiko-made shutter. It goes from one second down to 1/500 and features a bulb mode as well. My camera struggles with the two longest shutter speeds, but works more than fine on all others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to having a leaf shutter, it&amp;rsquo;s very much possible to take images in lower light conditions, despite the lens only opening up to 3,5.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/suzukipressvan/blurrylowlight.jpg&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: darkblue;&#34; &gt;Slightly blurry but decent enough photo taken inside in a dimly lit room.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;viewfinder-rangefinder-and-focus&#34;&gt;Viewfinder, rangefinder and focus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably noticed, there are three small windows on the front. This usually means that there&amp;rsquo;s an uncoupled rangefinder. That&amp;rsquo;s not the case here, though. The rangefinder mechanism is coupled, but the rangefinder and the viewfinder are separated. This is apparently much like older Leica cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/suzukipressvan/viewfinder.jpg&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: darkblue;&#34; &gt;Rangefinder and viewfinder.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h5 id=&#34;rangefinder&#34;&gt;Rangefinder&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing is very easy due to the clear rangefinder patch, both in daylight and low-lit conditions. Being separated allows for the rangefinder to be very zoomed in which provides you with an unparalleled ease of focusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view around the rangefinder is tinted slightly blue whereas the rangefinder patch itself is tinted slightly pink. This makes the focusing &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; easier than it otherwise would&amp;rsquo;ve been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;viewfinder&#34;&gt;Viewfinder&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only wish is that the viewfinder had been a bit larger, as framing can sometimes take a bit of concentration. Since the camera shoots two formats, the viewfinder is also equipped with a 4,5 mask on the sides. I think it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be kind of see-through. It&amp;rsquo;s yellowed with age on my camera and feels pretty pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;focus-dial&#34;&gt;Focus dial&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To turn the focus, you turn the dial on the top right of the camera. It&amp;rsquo;s sadly marked in feet instead of metres. The knob to the left is just a reminder wheel for you to remember what kind of film you&amp;rsquo;ve currently got rolled up inside. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually affect any settings.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/suzukipressvan/ovan.jpg&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to a video from Japan Vintage Camera on YouTube, a common problem with these is that the focus wheel gets stiff. Mine was when I bought it, but it was very easy to open it up and apply some lube to the mechanism. After I did, it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to focus. Zone focusing wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work very well for me, however, as I grew up with the metric system&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feel-and-subjective-opinions&#34;&gt;Feel and subjective opinions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be the most important feature, sometimes overlooked in reviews. In my opinion, this camera handles really well. Having to first check focus in one window to then move on the frame in another can be quite annoying, but you get used to it pretty quick. If something happens where you really need to get the shot, you can always snap away while looking through the rangefinder window. After having put a few rolls through it, you get fairly accustomed to the difference in framing between the two windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the controls on the front of the lens can also be quite frustrating, but having the aperture &amp;ldquo;ring&amp;rdquo; click is a very welcome feature. If the shutter speed could also click, I&amp;rsquo;d almost give it a full score. Not that I&amp;rsquo;m keeping one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest gripe with it is that it&amp;rsquo;s not a folder camera. It has bellows that extend, but the lens element and the controls do not fold. This limits my ability to keep it in my pocket out of fear that I might scratch the lens element or that the shutter or aperture lever might get stuck in a loose thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Suzuki Press Van-120 is overall an amazing camera. If I could do the purchase all over again, I&amp;rsquo;d probably pick a folder over it to be able to keep it in my pocket. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve bought it? I&amp;rsquo;m more than satisfied with it, especially the amazing quality of the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a short video showcasing the features of the camera. It&amp;rsquo;s just two minutes long and with no speech. It showcases all the features that the camera comes with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The name&amp;rsquo;s Erik. I&amp;rsquo;m a 26 year old guy from Sweden who&amp;rsquo;s into analogue photography. My interest arose when I got handed my father&amp;rsquo;s old Nikon FE2 back in 2017 and subsequently started shooting film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like everyone else interested in analogue photography I&amp;rsquo;ve collected too many cameras over the few years I&amp;rsquo;ve been into the hobby. I created this blog as a way to write down my thoughts about the cameras I own and possibly a few ones I end up selling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
