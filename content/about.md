The name's Erik. I'm a 26 year old guy from Sweden who's into analogue photography. My interest arose when I got handed my father's old Nikon FE2 back in 2017 and subsequently started shooting film. 

Just like everyone else interested in analogue photography I've collected too many cameras over the few years I've been into the hobby. I created this blog as a way to write down my thoughts about the cameras I own and possibly a few ones I end up selling.
