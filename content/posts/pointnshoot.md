## Introduction
A few years ago when I was just getting into film photography, around 2017, I found a lot of YouTube videos about the Olympus XA. It's a tiny point n' shoot featuring a rangefinder focus system. Great, huh? 

The only problem is its price. It's been hyped up over the years and they're now quite costly if you want one in good condition and working order --- and you do. Since they're all electrical cameras, you can't simply get them fixed if you receive a broken one or if it ends up breaking.

I chose to go another route, instead buying the Olympus XA2 on eBay for about 22 euros. It's a lot cheaper because they threw out the rangefinder in favour of a zone focus system and an f3.5 lens instead of the XA's 2.8. To cut it short - I love it. It was my favourite point n' shoot, until I found the Minolta AF-C. Now things aren't as clear.

After looking around for other cameras on the Swedish equivalent of eBay, I wound up purchasing a Minolta AF-C for about 100 Swedish crowns (roughly 10 dollars/euros). The Minolta AF-C sports an f2.8 lens and an early 80's auto focus system. The point of this post is to compare these two fairly inexpensive point n' shoots to see what they have to offer.

Like with my previous (and first) post on this blog, I'd love it if you were to check out my photography work. You can find my portfolio **[here](https://kallmoraberget.com/)**.

## Olympus XA2

I've chose to begin with the Olympus XA2, as it's the one I've had the longest and have the most experience with.

{{< figure src="/pointnshoot/olympusxa2.jpg" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Olympus XA2" captionPosition="center" captionStyle="color: darkblue;" >}}

### Build and functions

The camera is very small, compact and made entirely out of plastic. However, it's very dense and "built like a tank" despite its plastic build.

Everything in the camera's inner workings is entirely electronic and it's therefore not possible to have it fixed if it were to break down. This is the reality for most point n' shoots, though.

Underneath the camera, there's a small lever with two settings --- battery check and self timer. It also works as a small stand for the camera when using the self timer.

Directly to the left of the lens is the focus slider. On this, you have three settings to choose between. Flower, person or mountain --- macro, normal portrait distance or infinity focus. My biggest gripe with this is that once you shut the clamshell, the focus returns to the middle option. If you're out shooting and need to use the macro or the landscape focus distances and shut the camera, you have to remember to set the focus every time you open the clamshell up. This has cost me quite a few images as I always tend to forget.

### Lens

It sports a 35mm f3.5 lens that's, in my opinion at least, very very sharp. I'll attach a photo below.

If we look at a slightly zoomed in version of this photo, it's very easy to make out the lettering on the sign that says "FRISÃ–R" in the distance. 

{{< figure src="/pointnshoot/olympusxa2zoom.png" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="The very same street, zoomed in." captionPosition="center" captionStyle="color: darkblue;" >}}

The only downside I can find to the lens is really the maximum aperture of f3.5. It can be a downside in darker environments. There is quite an easy remedy, though.

### The flash!

{{< figure src="/pointnshoot/olympusxa2flash.jpg" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="The camera with the flash accessory." captionPosition="center" captionStyle="color: darkblue;" >}}

If you buy this camera, I would strongly advise you to get one with the screw-on flash attachment. There are two different ones --- the A11 and the A16. The A16 is stronger and recharges faster, but is also bigger. The A11 is the one that most usually comes bundled with the camera at auctions.

The flash attachment makes it possible and easy to take photos in lower lit situations.

{{< figure src="/pointnshoot/dinner.jpg" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Flash photo from a dinner party." captionPosition="center" captionStyle="color: darkblue;" >}}

As seen in the photo above, it's quite capable in dimly lit situations as long as the flash's attached. The flash isn't overbearing and renders quite good results. Granted, I've only shot black and white. I doubt it'd work as well for slide film.

### Ergonomics

Well, it's small and comapct as can be. It may not be the most ergonomic camera in the world, but it's also not bad in any way. You can open it and set any settings one handed when you get used to handling it.

It has a small red touch button on the top right that acts as a shutter button. 

### Ease of use and quirks

It's very very easy to use. Apart from the focus, it's an all automatic point n' shoot. Since the focus is divided up into three zones, it doesn't require a brain surgeon to figure out what setting to use.

One of the quirks is most definitely what I mentioned earlier, how it resets the focus distance once you close the clamshell up. I fucking hate it. I've lost several good shots over the years by forgetting to set the focus again after closing it and opening it up again.

One really good thing about it, however, is that it doesn't block you from taking photos if it deems the scene too dark. It lights up with a green LED to notify you that it's too dark, but then it fires the shutter at the longest possible shutter speed and the largest possible aperture.

## Minolta AF-C

I've not owned the Minolta AF-C for as long, but I'll do my best to give a short summary over its specifications, quirks and quality.

{{< figure src="/pointnshoot/minoltaafc.jpg" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="From the back" captionPosition="center" captionStyle="color: darkblue;" >}}

### Build and functions

Unlike the Olympys XA2, the Minolta AF-C is definitely **not** built like a tank. It feels significantly more plasticky and some parts of it can sometimes feel a bit loose and creaky. 

Also unlike its counterpart, it's not a clamshell design. It features a downward sliding door to protect the lens and the viewfinder.
